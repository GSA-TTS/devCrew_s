| Version | Supported          |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.

### Process

1. **Do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send a detailed report to the security team via private communication
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested mitigation if known

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 5 business days  
- **Status Updates**: Weekly or as significant progress is made
- **Resolution**: Timeline depends on severity and complexity

### Disclosure Policy

- We follow responsible disclosure practices
- Security fixes will be released as soon as possible
- Public disclosure will occur after fixes are available
- Credit will be given to reporters (unless they prefer anonymity)

## Security Considerations

### Documentation Security
- Avoid including sensitive information in documentation
- Use placeholder values for examples (never real credentials)
- Review all documentation for potential information disclosure
- Maintain an inventory of security-sensitive documentation

### Access Control
- Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive documents
- Use branch protection rules for critical documentation
- Require reviews for security-related changes
- Monitor access to security documentation
