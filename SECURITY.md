# Security Policy

## DevCrew Security Framework

The DevCrew framework incorporates security at every layer through dedicated protocols and agent specifications. This document outlines our security policies, vulnerability reporting procedures, and security-first development practices.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

### What to Report

#### In Agent Specifications or Protocols:
- Security vulnerabilities in recommended practices
- Missing security validations in workflows
- Potential attack vectors in agent interactions
- Inadequate access control specifications
- Data leakage risks in protocols

#### In Documentation:
- Exposed sensitive information
- Credentials or API keys accidentally included
- Misleading security guidance
- Privacy concerns

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities

2. Use one of these secure reporting methods:
   - Open a **private security advisory** on GitHub (preferred)
   - Email security concerns to: [security@devcrew.dev] (encrypted preferred)
   - Use the GitHub Security tab to report privately

3. Include in your report:
   - **Component**: Agent, Protocol, or Documentation affected
   - **Description**: Clear explanation of the vulnerability
   - **Impact**: Potential security implications
   - **Reproduction**: Steps to identify/exploit the issue
   - **Suggested Fix**: Recommendations if available
   - **Severity Assessment**: Your evaluation (Critical/High/Medium/Low)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours for Critical, 48 hours for others
- **Impact Assessment**: Within 2 business days
- **Status Updates**: Every 72 hours for Critical, weekly for others
- **Resolution Target**:
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 60 days

### Security Vulnerability Severity

| Severity | Description | Examples |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| **Critical** | Immediate risk to production systems | Authentication bypass, RCE in protocols |
| **High** | Significant security impact | Data exposure, privilege escalation |
| **Medium** | Moderate risk requiring mitigation | Missing input validation, weak encryption |
| **Low** | Minor issues with minimal impact | Information disclosure, best practice violations |

## Security Best Practices

### For Protocol Contributors

1. **Security-First Design**:
   - Include authentication/authorization steps
   - Implement input validation
   - Add rate limiting where appropriate
   - Include audit logging requirements

2. **Error Handling**:
   - Never expose sensitive information in errors
   - Implement proper failure modes
   - Include rollback procedures (P-RECOVERY)

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Specify encryption requirements
   - Define data retention policies
   - Include data sanitization steps

### For Agent Specifications

1. **Access Control**:
   - Define clear permission boundaries
   - Specify least privilege principles
   - Include role-based access controls

2. **Agent Communication**:
   - Use secure message formats
   - Implement message signing/verification
   - Include replay attack prevention

3. **Compliance Integration**:
   - Reference relevant security protocols
   - Include compliance checkpoints
   - Define audit trail requirements

### For Documentation

1. **Never commit sensitive data**:
   - No real credentials, API keys, or tokens
   - No internal IP addresses or hostnames
   - No personally identifiable information (PII)
   - Use placeholders like `<YOUR_API_KEY>` in examples

2. **Review before committing**:
   - Double-check for sensitive information
   - Ensure examples use safe, non-functional values
   - Verify planning documents don't expose security details

## Security Review Process

All contributions undergo security review:

1. **Automated Scanning**: PRs are scanned for:
   - Credentials and secrets
   - Known vulnerable patterns
   - Security anti-patterns

2. **Manual Review**: Security team reviews:
   - New protocols for security gaps
   - Agent specifications for attack vectors
   - Documentation for sensitive information

3. **Security Testing**: For protocols involving:
   - Authentication/authorization
   - Data handling
   - External integrations
