# P-PRIVACY-BY-DESIGN: Privacy by Design (PbD) Lifecycle Protocol

## Objective
A master protocol that integrates data privacy considerations into every phase of the P-FEATURE-DEV lifecycle based on the seven foundational principles of Privacy by Design (PbD).

## Trigger
The initiation of the P-FEATURE-DEV protocol.

## Action Sequence
This protocol acts as a wrapper for feature development.

- It immediately triggers the **P-PIA (Privacy Impact Assessment)** protocol for an upfront risk analysis.
- Findings from the PIA are formally integrated into the `prd.md` and `tech_spec.md`.
- It invokes the **P-AGILE-PRIVACY** protocol to translate these requirements into trackable user stories.
- It enforces gated design and development by invoking the **P-CONSENT-DESIGN**, **P-DATA-MINIMIZATION**, and **P-ETHICAL-DESIGN** protocols as mandatory checks.
