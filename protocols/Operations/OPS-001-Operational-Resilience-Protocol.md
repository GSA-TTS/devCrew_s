# OPS-001: Operational Resilience Protocol

## Objective
Ensure operational continuity through robust error handling and file management.

## Steps

### 1. Error Handling
- **GitHub CLI Resilience:** Fallback procedures for API failures.
- **Issue Validation:** Verify issue numbers, provide recovery steps.
- **ADR Gap Detection:** Flag missing ADRs with priority recommendations.

### 2. File Management
- **Directory Creation:** Auto-create required structures.
- **Naming Conventions:** Enforce consistent patterns.
- **Backup Protocol:** Version and backup files before changes.
- **Cache Management:** Cleanup procedures with conflict resolution.
- **Checksum Verification:** For all key documents to detect corruption or unauthorized changes. After saving a file, compute its SHA256 checksum and append to a ledger.
