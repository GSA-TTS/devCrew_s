# P-SEC-CHAOS: Security Chaos Engineering Protocol

## Objective
To proactively identify weaknesses in security controls and incident response procedures by conducting controlled, hypothesis-driven security experiments in production or production-like environments.

## Trigger
Scheduled on a regular basis (e.g., quarterly) by the `@Security-Auditor` to test a specific security control.

## Phases & Key Steps

1. **Define Hypothesis**: The `@Security-Auditor` defines a specific, measurable hypothesis. For example: "We hypothesize that our EDR agent will detect and block a simulated ransomware process on a production web server within 60 seconds."

2. **Scope and Plan Experiment**: The agent defines the experiment's "blast radius" to minimize potential impact. It schedules the experiment during a low-traffic window and pre-notifies the `@SRE-Agent` and relevant stakeholders.

3. **Execute Experiment**: The `@Security-Auditor` uses a specialized tool (e.g., an MCP for an attack simulation platform) to execute the experimentâ€”for example, by launching a benign process that mimics ransomware behavior.

4. **Observe and Measure**: The `@Security-Auditor` and `@SRE-Agent` observe the system's response, collecting data from monitoring and security tools to validate or refute the hypothesis. Did the alert fire? Was the process blocked? How long did it take?

5. **Analyze and Improve**: The results are analyzed. If the experiment reveals a weakness (e.g., the detection took 5 minutes instead of the expected 60 seconds), a formal remediation task is created and prioritized to strengthen the security control.
