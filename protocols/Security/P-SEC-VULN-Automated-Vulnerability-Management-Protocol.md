# P-SEC-VULN: Automated Vulnerability Management Protocol

## Objective
To provide a continuous, proactive workflow for identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and remediating security vulnerabilities across the entire IT infrastructure.

## Trigger
A scheduled, continuous process or the detection of a new asset.

## Phases & Key Steps

1. **Identification**: The @Security-Auditor uses automated scanners to continuously discover vulnerabilities across all assets.

2. **Assessment & Prioritization**: The agent enriches the raw vulnerability data with context from threat intelligence feeds and the business criticality of the asset to create a prioritized, risk-based action plan.

3. **Remediation**: The @Orchestrator consumes the prioritized list and automatically generates and delegates remediation tasks to the appropriate agent.

4. **Verification**: After a fix is applied, the @Security-Auditor re-scans the asset to verify the vulnerability is no longer present, closing the feedback loop.
