# P-API-DEV: API Development Lifecycle Protocol

## Objective
To manage the full lifecycle of an API as a product, from planning to retirement, ensuring consistency, security, and maintainability.

## Phases & Key Steps

1. **Design & Prototyping**: The @System-Architect defines the API contract in a formal specification (e.g., openapi.yaml).

2. **Implementation**: The @Backend-Engineer implements the API according to the contract, strictly following the **P-TDD** protocol.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: The @QA-Tester executes a suite of automated functional, performance, and security tests.

4. **Deployment & Versioning**: The @DevOps-Engineer deploys the API and implements a clear versioning strategy.

5. **Monitoring & Management**: The @SRE-Agent continuously monitors the API for performance, uptime, and error rates.

6. **Retirement**: The @Orchestrator initiates a formal deprecation process when a version is to be retired.
