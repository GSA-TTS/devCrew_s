# FEEDBACK-INGEST-001: Customer & Stakeholder Feedback Ingestion Protocol

## Objective
Systematically incorporate feedback into backlog.

## Steps

1. Retrieve raw feedback from `/integrations/support/tickets_{{date}}.json` and `/integrations/analytics/surveys_{{date}}.json`.

2. Normalize feedback into user needs statements.

3. Run **Analogy-Driven Prioritization** to match `need_id` to existing features; flag new needs.

4. Append new needs to `/docs/product/backlog/backlog_{{sprint_id}}.yaml` under `user_needs:` with `Priority: TBD`.

5. Commit and comment on feedback source threads.
