# PAT-001: Architectural Pattern Management Protocol

## Objective
Maintain and evolve the architectural pattern catalog and detect anti-patterns.

## Steps

1. **Pattern Discovery:** Use **Analogical Reasoning** to identify successful patterns from past ADRs.

2. **Pattern Validation:** Apply **Contrastive Analysis** to evaluate pattern effectiveness.

3. **Catalog Maintenance:** Update `/docs/architecture/pattern-catalog` with contexts and metrics.

4. **Anti-Pattern Detection:** Integrate automated checks during ADR creation.

5. **Pattern Recommendation:** Provide context-aware recommendations via **Multi-Perspective Synthesis**.
