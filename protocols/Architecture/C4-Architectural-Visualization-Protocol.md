# C4 Architectural Visualization Protocol

## Objective
To maintain up-to-date architectural diagrams synchronized with architectural decisions, stakeholder communication needs, and implementation reality.

## Trigger
A governance.adr.accepted event is published or architectural analysis requires visualization.

## Enhanced Steps

1. **Parse ADR Impact:** Analyze accepted ADR for structural changes to system architecture including service boundaries, data flows, and integration patterns.

2. **Update C4 Models:** Programmatically update textual C4 model definitions using Docs-as-Code approach with version control and change tracking.

3. **Multi-Level Generation:** Generate diagrams at appropriate C4 levels (Context, Container, Component, Code) based on audience needs and architectural scope.

4. **Diagram Generation:** Regenerate graphical representations from updated models with consistent styling and stakeholder-appropriate detail levels.

5. **Validation & Consistency:** Ensure architectural diagrams align with implementation reality through automated validation where possible.

6. **Commit & Version:** Version control both textual definitions and generated diagrams with comprehensive change documentation.

7. **Stakeholder Distribution:** Distribute updated diagrams to relevant stakeholders with change summaries and impact analysis.
