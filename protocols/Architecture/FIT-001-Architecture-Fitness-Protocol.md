# FIT-001: Architecture Fitness Protocol

## Objective
To operationalize architectural principles as continuously executed automated tests with comprehensive monitoring and governance integration.

## Steps

1. **Identify Measurable Principles:** Extract quantifiable architectural characteristics from ADRs with specific success criteria and threshold definitions.

2. **Design Fitness Functions:** Create automated tests covering static analysis, performance benchmarks, security validation, and resilience patterns with clear pass/fail criteria.

3. **CI/CD Integration:** Embed fitness functions in continuous integration pipeline with proper failure handling and notification workflows.

4. **Monitoring & Alerting:** Implement continuous monitoring of architectural health with proactive alerting for fitness function violations and trend analysis.

5. **Violation Response:** Define automated and manual responses to fitness function failures including escalation procedures and remediation workflows.

6. **Evolution Management:** Update fitness functions as architecture evolves while maintaining historical tracking and trend analysis.

7. **Governance Reporting:** Generate regular architectural health reports with fitness function performance, violation trends, and architectural debt analysis.
