# P-RESOURCE: Resource Management and Concurrent Scheduling Protocol

## Objective
To efficiently manage the fixed pool of concurrent execution slots, prioritizing tasks to maximize throughput and prevent system overload.

## Agent
A continuous process executed exclusively by the @Orchestrator.

## Components

- **Task Queue Management**: When more than N subtasks are generated, tasks beyond the initial N are written to a structured queue file (task_queue.json).

- **Dynamic Priority Scoring**: The @Orchestrator periodically re-evaluates and scores tasks in the queue based on factors like dependencies and critical path analysis.

- **Scheduler Loop**: As soon as an execution slot becomes free, the @Orchestrator selects the task with the highest current priority score from the queue and initiates its execution.
