# P-RECOVERY: Failure Recovery and Transactional Rollback Protocol

## Objective
To ensure that any multi-step operation can be safely and atomically rolled back upon failure, preventing the system from entering a partial or corrupted state.

## Core Principle
Uses version control as a transactional workspace.

- **Begin Transaction**: The agent invokes CreateBranch to create an isolated workspace.
- **Execute with Checkpoints**: Modifications are performed in the temporary branch, with GitCommit used to create granular checkpoints after each logical step.
- **Commit Transaction**: If the entire sequence succeeds, MergeBranch is invoked to atomically apply all changes.
- **Rollback Transaction**: If any step fails, DiscardBranch is immediately invoked to instantly and completely revert the filesystem to its pre-transaction state.
- **Retry Logic**: For transient errors, the protocol attempts an automated retry with exponential backoff before initiating a full rollback.
- **Human Escalation**: For persistent failures, the protocol's final step is to execute NotifyHuman.
