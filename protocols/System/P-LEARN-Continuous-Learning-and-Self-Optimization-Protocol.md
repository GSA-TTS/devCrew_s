# P-LEARN: Continuous Learning and Self-Optimization Protocol

## Objective
To create an automated feedback loop that allows the Dev-Crew to learn from its operational data and autonomously improve the efficiency and reliability of its agents and workflows.

## Agent
The primary function of the @Prompt-Engineer-Agent.

## Trigger
Can be run on a schedule or triggered dynamically by high failure rates.

## Steps

1. **Data Collection & Analysis**: Invokes AnalyzeAgentLogs to gather and aggregate historical performance data, looking for recurring failure modes.

2. **Hypothesis Generation**: The @Prompt-Engineer-Agent analyzes the data to form a hypothesis about the root cause of underperformance.

3. **Variant Creation**: Executes ProposePromptChange to generate a targeted modification to an agent's system prompt or tool definitions.

4. **Controlled Experiment (A/B Test)**: Runs an ExecutePromptABTest, executing a benchmark suite of tasks with both the original and variant prompts and programmatically comparing the outcomes.

5. **Validation & Deployment**: If the variant shows a statistically significant improvement, the agent applies the validated change to the agent's official definition file in the version-controlled repository, completing the learning loop.
