# DevCrew Proposed Agents Registry

## üìã Overview

This directory contains **unofficial agent specifications** that are under development, review, or awaiting approval for integration into the official DevCrew multi-agent system. These proposed agents represent potential extensions and enhancements to the DevCrew ecosystem but require significant vetting and revision before becoming production-ready.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Status Notice

**IMPORTANT**: All agents in this folder are considered **PROPOSED** and **UNOFFICIAL**. They:
- Have not been fully vetted for production use
- May contain incomplete or untested specifications
- Require review, revision, and approval before adoption
- Should not be deployed in production environments without thorough evaluation

## üéØ Purpose

The Proposed Agents Registry serves as:
- An innovation sandbox for new agent concepts
- A collaborative space for agent specification development
- A staging area for agents undergoing review and refinement
- A community contribution hub for extending DevCrew capabilities

## ü§ù Contributing

### Why Contribute Proposed Agents?

- **Innovation**: Introduce new capabilities to the DevCrew ecosystem
- **Specialization**: Add domain-specific expertise
- **Integration**: Connect DevCrew with external systems and tools
- **Optimization**: Improve existing workflows with specialized agents

### Contribution Types

#### Create New Agent Specifications

1. **Identify a Gap**: Find a missing capability or role in the current DevCrew system
2. **Define Clear Purpose**: Establish specific responsibilities and boundaries
3. **Leverage Existing Protocols**: Reuse standardized protocols where applicable
4. **Document Thoroughly**: Follow the specification template completely

#### Improve Existing Proposed Agents

1. **Review Current Specs**: Identify incomplete or unclear sections
2. **Add Missing Details**: Fill gaps in protocols, workflows, or governance
3. **Enhance Integration**: Improve coordination with other agents
4. **Validate Feasibility**: Test proposed workflows and patterns

### Best Practices for Agent Design

#### 1. **Protocol Reuse**
- **Mandatory**: Use existing protocol codes (e.g., GH-1, P-TDD, P-RECOVERY)
- **Reference Format**: `Execute protocol: GH-1 with parameters {{issue_number}}`
- **Avoid Duplication**: Don't redefine existing protocols

#### 2. **Clear Boundaries**
- Define explicit scope and responsibilities
- Avoid overlap with existing agents
- Specify handoff points clearly

#### 3. **Memory Architecture**
- Define short-term, long-term, and collaborative memory
- Specify data formats and storage locations
- Include cache management strategies

#### 4. **Integration Design**
- Use standard message formats
- Define clear input/output contracts
- Specify event triggers and responses

#### 5. **Governance Integration**
- Include quality gates and validation steps
- Define escalation paths
- Specify compliance requirements

#### 6. **Testing Strategy**
- Include testability in the design
- Define performance benchmarks
- Specify validation criteria

### Submission Process

1. **Fork & Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b proposed-agent/[agent-name]
   ```

2. **Use Template**
   - Copy `AI Agent Specification Template.md`
   - Fill all required sections
   - Use standardized protocol codes

3. **Validate Specification**
   - Ensure all sections are complete
   - Check protocol references are valid
   - Verify no conflicts with existing agents

4. **Documentation**
   - Include rationale for the agent
   - Provide use case examples
   - Document integration scenarios

5. **Submit PR**
   - Title: `[Proposed Agent] Category: Agent-Name`
   - Description: Include purpose, key features, and protocol usage
   - Label: `proposed-agent`, `needs-review`

6. **Review Process**
   - Technical review for completeness
   - Architecture review for integration
   - Governance review for compliance
   - Community feedback period

## üìä Specification Maturity Levels

| Level | Description | Criteria |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| üî¥ **Draft** | Initial concept | Basic structure, <50% complete |
| üü° **In Review** | Under active development | 50-80% complete, needs revision |
| üü¢ **Ready for Vetting** | Complete specification | 100% complete, awaiting approval |
| ‚úÖ **Approved** | Ready for promotion | Vetted, revised, ready for official status |

## ‚úÖ Review Criteria

Proposed agents are evaluated against:

1. **Completeness**: All template sections filled
